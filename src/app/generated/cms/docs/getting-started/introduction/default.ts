  "content": "Sapphire CMS (also referred to simply as Sapphire) is an open-source, modular headless content management system designed to deliver a seamless editing experience for websites and web applications.\n\nSapphire was designed from the ground up to be environment-agnostic, truly headless, and embeddable. It can run in modern serverless and edge environments, serve content to frontends built with any framework, and integrate seamlessly into your blog, website, or app.\n\nSapphire is a low-code, low-config tool. You don’t need to be a developer to spin up your own CMS — knowing how to run a few terminal commands and edit a couple of `YAML` files is enough.\n\nIf you prefer a fully non-technical experience for integrating a CMS into your business, check out our cloud solution **Sapphire ZerØ**, which enables live editing capabilities on your existing website through a single tag added via Google Tag Manager (GTM).\n\nDevelopers can easily extend Sapphire’s capabilities by creating custom modules, in case the feature you need isn’t yet provided by one of the many official or community-maintained modules. Check the “Development” section to learn how to create your own module.\n\nWe hope your experience with Sapphire CMS will be polished and shiny."
