# Features

## Microscopic Core, Modular Design

Start small and grow as you go. All you need is a GitHub account and Docker to start publishing content.
Sapphire CMS uses a tiny core that can be progressively enhanced with plug-and-play modules as your project grows.

## Built for the Serverless World

Sapphire CMS is a first-class citizen of the serverless ecosystem.
Deploy effortlessly to Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Workers, Firebase Functions, AWS Lambda, and more.

## Headless & Framework-Agnostic

Use any frontend you want — Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, Svelte, or plain HTML.
Sapphire CMS delivers content via flexible, decoupled APIs that fit any stack.

## Lightning-Fast Content Delivery

Render and push content directly to CDNs or edge databases.
Enjoy near-zero latency delivery that feels like content is hardcoded into your app, but with full CMS flexibility.

## Content Shapers for Every Channel

Target different platforms with precision.
Use content shapers to tailor output for:

- Mobile vs Desktop
- Social media (e.g. Twitter/X)
- Newsletters or SEO snippets
  Resize images, shorten text, plug in AI — shape your content pipeline like a pro.

## Instant Visual Editing

Edit your content live and visually, right from the page.
Use the Sapphire CMS Chrome or Firefox plugin to fix typos or tweak text directly on your production site.

## Serverless Search Engine

Integrate Sapphire Search — a lightweight, fast, serverless-native search engine built just for Sapphire CMS.
Enable your users to search content instantly, without relying on bloated third-party search services.
